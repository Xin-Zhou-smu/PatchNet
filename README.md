## Data & Pretrained models:

Please following the link below to download the data and pretrained models of our paper. 

- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vO4eF4tma94tsBljLMvVXdG2K4sKOC3s?usp=sharing

After downloading, simply copy the data and model folders to PatchNet folder. 

## Hyperparameters:
We have a number of different parameters

* --embedding_dim: Dimension of embedding vectors.
* --filter_sizes: Sizes of filters used by the convolutional neural network. 
* --num_filters: Number of filters. 
* --hidden_layers: Number of hidden layers. 
* --dropout_keep_prob: Dropout for training. 
* --l2_reg_lambda: Regularization rate. 
* --learning_rate: Learning rate. 
* --batch_size: Batch size. 
* --num_epochs: Number of epochs. 

## Running and evalutation
      
- To train the model for bug fixing patch classification, please follow this command: 

      $ python main.py -train -train_data [path of our data] -dictionary_data [path of our dictionary data]
      
- To evaluate the model for bug fixing patch classification, please follow this command:
      
       $ python main.py -predict -pred_data [path of our data] -dictionary_data [path of our dictionary data] -load_model [path of our model]
