## Running and evaluation

If you only download our dataset and want to train it by yourself,  please follow the instructions (step1&2) below. 

Or if you want to directly use our pretrained model to reproduce the results, please only use the command in the step2 and give the path of the pretrained model to '--load_model'.  
      
Step 1. To train the model for bug fixing patch classification, please follow this command: 

       $ python main.py -train -train_data [path of our data] -dictionary_data [path of our dictionary data]
   For example:
       
       $ python main.py -train -train_data './small_data/train.pkl' -dictionary_data './small_data/dict.pkl' -train_valid_ratio 0.3
   If you want to evaluate all trained models on validation set, then you need to add two options: -valid and -train_valid_ratio.
   
   -valid: choose to do validation
   
   -train_valid_ratio : the split ratio bewteen training data and validation data (validation data is split from train.pkl).
        
        $ python main.py -train -valid -train_data './small_data/train.pkl' -dictionary_data './small_data/dict.pkl' -train_valid_ratio 0.3
   The validation will show the evaluation metrics and the recommended 'best models'. Users can load the recommended models when doing prediction.
 
Step 2. To utilize trained models to give predictions on unlabeled bug fixing patches:
      
       $ python main.py -predict -pred_data [path of our data] -dictionary_data [path of our dictionary data] -load_model [path of our model]
   For example:     
  
       $ python main.py -predict -pred_data './small_data/test.pkl' -dictionary_data './small_data/dict.pkl' -load_model './snapshot/2020-12-01_07-45-03/epoch_20.pt'
       
  After running this command, the result.txt will be stored in folder './result' and each line of result.txt is "patch_id [Space] predicted_scores".
  
  Notes:
    "-load_model"  parameter needs the path to the saved model. In the training phase, PatchNet will automatically save some intermediate models during the training process (when we finish a training process, we can see them), which are stored in folder "snapshot". In the "snapshot" folder, there are folders named by "year-month-day-hour-minute-second" way, to represent the time when models are stored.
    
   In each "year-month-day-hour-minute-second" folder, there are many intermediate model files named by "epoch_x.pt" (x is a number). For example, "epoch_20.pt" means the model is saved after training 20 epochs.
     
   We need to load these stored models when doing prediction. If we load "epoch_20.pt" and do prediction, that means we only evaluate the performance of the model "epoch_20.pt" (model saved at 20th epoch). You can choose the recommend models of validation results in step1.
     
## Train on New Dataset
### Preprocess Data
please refer to the preprocessing folder for details on how we preprocess patches.
### Change the format of Dataset
As the collected dataset from the preprocessing folder has a different format, we cannot directly use the data to train and test PatchNet.
It needs to change its format following instructions below:

1.  build dictionary-form dataset from the text-form data     
     
       
        $ python text2dict.py -text_path  [path of text data] -dict_path [path of the dictionary data want to store]  -print True
   
    Examples to generate train.pkl and test.pkl (*.out files are data collected from preprocessing folder)
      
        $ python text2dict.py -text_path  'train_data.out' -dict_path 'train.pkl'  
        $ python text2dict.py -text_path  'test_data.out' -dict_path 'test.pkl' 
        
       
     
     
2. build vocabulary dictionary from text-form data
      
       $ python generate_dict.py -text_path1 [path of our data1] -text_path2 [path of our data2] -dict_path [path we want to store dict.pkl]
    Examples to generate dict.pkl (*.out files are data collected from preprocessing folder):
    
       $ python generate_dict.py -text_path1 'training_data.out' -text_path2 'test_data.out' -dict_path 'dict.pkl'
    Notes:
    training_data.out is the "text format" training dataset and test_data.out is the "text format" testing dataset. The reason why we need testing data (test_data.out) to build vocabulary dictionary is that if we only build a dictionary based on training dataset (training_data.out), there may be some words in test_data.out which never appear in training_data.out. In this case, the generated "dict.pkl" is not the whole vocabulary. 
    If you don't want use test data in generating the vocabulary file dict.pkl, we can change the command into this, to only use training data:
   
       $ python generate_dict.py -text_path1 'training_data.out' -text_path2 'training_data.out' -dict_path 'dict.pkl'
### Train and Test on new dataset
Aftering generating new train.pkl, testing.pkl and dict.pkl, please follow the commands in section "Running and evaluation" and only need to replace the dataset with your own dataset.
